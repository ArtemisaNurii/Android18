    question: 'What types of software projects do you take on?',
    answer:
      'We build everything from MVPs and mobile apps to large-scale SaaS platforms, internal tools, and complex cloud back-ends. If it involves custom code, we can probably handle it.',

    question: 'Which technologies and frameworks do you specialize in?',
    answer:
      'Our core stack includes React / Next.js on the front-end and Node.js, .NET, and Python (Django/FastAPI) on the back-end. We also work with popular cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP), SQL & NoSQL databases, and DevOps tools like Docker and Kubernetes.',

    id: 3,
    question: 'How do you estimate project timelines and budgets?',
    answer:
      'After a short discovery call, we break requirements into user stories, size them, and produce a detailed estimate with phased milestones. You get both time and cost ranges before we start coding.',

    question: 'Will I own the source code and intellectual property?',

      'Absolutely. Upon final payment (or as specified in the contract), you receive full ownership of the source code and all related IP.',

    question: 'How will we communicate during the project?',

      'Youâ€™ll have a dedicated project manager and access to a shared Slack channel, weekly demo calls, and a live Jira/Kanban board so you can track progress in real time.',

    id: 6,
    question: 'What is your quality-assurance process?',
    answer:
      'We follow automated testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end) plus peer code reviews and continuous integration pipelines. Security scans and performance benchmarks are baked into every release.',
