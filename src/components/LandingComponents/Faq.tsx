    answer:
      'Our core stack includes React / Next.js on the front-end and Node.js, .NET, and Python (Django/FastAPI) on the back-end. We also work with popular cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP), SQL & NoSQL databases, and DevOps tools like Docker and Kubernetes.',

    id: 3,
    question: 'How do you estimate project timelines and budgets?',
    answer:
      'After a short discovery call, we break requirements into user stories, size them, and produce a detailed estimate with phased milestones. You get both time and cost ranges before we start coding.',
